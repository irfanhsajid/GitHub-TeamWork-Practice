//for creating new branch:

git checkout -b branchName 

//for conflict resolve either one of the developer  should open his terminal and pull the code from the origin

for example : git pull origin branch_name(the branch i want to pull, in general its the develpment branch)

git pull origin development 

accept current changes / accept incoming changes / accept both changes 

so, we should click accept both changes. and the merge conflict will be resolved.
